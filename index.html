            <p>If you are looking for a loan to buy or refinance your house, you need to know all the options that you have available.

            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Cost of each mortgage loan (interest, closing costs, legal fees, etc)</li>
                <li>Qualifications: you can NOT apply to every kind of loan.  There are qualifications for each one.  See to which one you qualify.</li>
                <li>Time to process:  your circumstances and options change depending on your situation.  If you need your loan today vs in a couple of months can make a big difference.  </li>
                <li>Use of the mortgage loan:  are you buying a house, refinancing it, getting a home equity line of credit?  Choose the mortgage that is more convenient for you, no for your lender.</li>
